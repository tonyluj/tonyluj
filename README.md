### Hello, This is Tony Lu ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± I used to be a full-stack engineer :-)
  - I built systems from frontend with HTML / CSS / JS / TS and Angular / React etc,
  - to backend with Java / Python / Ruby / Go / Rust and Spring / Rails etc,
  - then deploy them with Docker.
  
ðŸ”­ But I found something missing, So ;-)
- Iâ€™m currently working on Linux kernel network and eBPF.
- I'm trying to be a **TRUE** full-stack engineer.

Umm, not enough. I should start to learn RISC-V ;-)
